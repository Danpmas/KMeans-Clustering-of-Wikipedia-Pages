# KMeans-Clustering-of-Wikipedia-Pages
______________________________________

This project utilizes KMeans Clustering and similarity metrics to categorize over 100 Wikipedia sites into 5 groups. The data is persistently stored and retrieved using a custom built hashtable.
Replication of this program requires the following:

1. Run the Loader class to create and store files containing similarity calculations for each website.
2. Run the Main class to perform KMeans Clustering and display a graph with the 5 groups of categorized websites.
